# Operating-systems-Concepts_processes

this project finds The Gantt chart , The Average Waiting Time and The Average Turnaround Time for each of the following scheduling Algorithms:

1- First Come First Served(FCFS).

2- Shortest Job First(SJF).

3- Shortest Remaining Time First(SRTF).

4- Round Robin(RR) , with q = 5.

5- Preemptive Priority Scheduling , with aging ; where priority is decremented by 1 , if the process remains in the ready queue for 5 time units.

6- Non-preemptive Priority Scheduling , with aging ; where priority is decremented by 1 if , the process remains in the ready queue for 5 time units.
